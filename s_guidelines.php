<p>The Arcadian aims to build a global community of readers and connect thousands of books to its readers. When you submit your book to us, it will instantly be available to all of our reviewers on our platform. Reviewers select books on the basis of their genre and language, and if they choose yours, they will have 2 weeks to publish a review. Your book will have the opportunity to be featured on our website and our social media accounts. Submit your book to us and gain exposure to a plethora of readers. 
                </p>

<p>You can also opt for the author interview. We are sure your readers would like to know about the soul behind the book. After your book review is published, one of our reviewers will set up an interview with you. The interview will be available in our YouTube Channel and our author's page on our website.
